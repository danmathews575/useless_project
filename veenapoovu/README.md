🎭 വീണപൂവ് – The Worst AI Lawyer
An AI lawyer who always loses your case — and looks fabulous doing it.

📌 Overview
വീണപൂവ് (Veenapooov) is a totally useless yet entertaining AI experiment.
Instead of defending you, it beautifully crafts absurd legal arguments,
wastes your time in style, and makes sure you absolutely lose in court.

Perfect for fun demos, useless project competitions, or making your friends question your life choices.

✨ Features
Comically bad legal arguments generated using GPT (or silly local data if you’re broke).

Fake exhibits like Cheetos dust evidence or diagrams of suspicious cat behavior.

Sarcastic courtroom drama with random verdicts that never help you.

Zero legal value, 100% entertainment.
