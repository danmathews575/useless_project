🧠 ScrollPoints!
Because staring at a screen for hours should be rewarded, not just regretted.

📜 About
ScrollPoints! is a revolutionary (and by revolutionary, we mean completely unnecessary) Streamlit app that tracks how long you waste… sorry, invest… scrolling.

The longer you scroll, the more “points” you earn — and at the end, you get a certificate for your exceptional time-wasting skills. Perfect for impressing friends, family, and that one relative who still doesn’t know what you do for a living.

✨ Features
Timer-based point system — Finally, procrastination pays off!

Progress tracking — Watch your wasted time in real-time.

Certificate generator — Award yourself for doing nothing.

Activity points bait — Useless KTU students can even pretend this counts for Activity Points.

📦 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scrollpoints.git
cd scrollpoints

# Install the essentials
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔑 Setup API Key
You’ll need to add your API key to a .streamlit/secrets.toml file.

Example:

toml
Copy
Edit
[api_keys]
openai_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
🚀 Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🏆 Certificates
Once you reach a certain scroll time, the app automatically generates a certificate declaring you as a Master of Wasting Time.

📝 Disclaimer: These certificates are not recognized by any university or government (yet)… but KTU students can always try submitting it for Activity Points.

🤡 Why does this exist?
Because the world needs more projects that:

Make no sense

Provide no real-world value

Yet somehow take hours to build
