## 👥 Team RADO

## 📜 Introduction 

While normal students submit **one** serious project for evaluation, we — the **visionaries of pointlessness** — decided that wasn't enough. So instead, we proudly present **two gloriously useless creations**, doubling the confusion, sarcasm, and the eternal question: *"Why does this even exist?"*

We are **Team RADO** — where our name perfectly captures our philosophy: projects that make no sense but sound impressively innovative on paper.

## 🎯 The Projects

### 2️⃣ **വീണപൂവ് – The Worst AI Lawyer** ⚖️
> *An attorney who loses your case in style*

**What it delivers:**

## ⚡ Why These Masterpieces Exist
1. We rejected the tyranny of "useful" projects  
2. We champion the **art of productive-looking time wasting**  
3. Basic math: Two useless projects > one useless project  
4. KTU's submission portal needed more chaos

## 📌 Critical Disclaimer
- These projects are **legally useless** (especially the lawyer)  
- Certificates won't impress employers (unless they're cool)  
- വീണപൂവ് might get you jailed if used seriously  
- Team RADO accepts **zero responsibility** for:  
  • Existential crises • Failed interviews • Confused judges  
  • Questionable life choices • Sudden urges to become a llama farmer
