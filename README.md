# **Double the Uselessness – Team Name RADO**

**By:** Dan Mathews Vinu & Roshan Joy

---

## **📜 Introduction**

While normal students submit **one** serious project for evaluation, we — the **visionaries of pointlessness** — decided that wasn’t enough.

So instead of one project, we are proudly submitting **two gloriously useless creations**, doubling the confusion, the sarcasm, and the *“why does this even exist?”* factor.

We call ourselves **Team nME RADO** — because much like the name, our projects make no sense but sound fancy enough to pass as “innovative” in a PowerPoint presentation.

## **🎯 The Projects**

### 1️⃣ **Certificate Generator for Useless Achievements**

> For those moments in life when you accomplish absolutely nothing… but still want a certificate.

**What it does**

* Generates **completely pointless certificates** for fake achievements.
* Lets lazy people collect *Activity Points* for KTU without actually doing anything meaningful.
* Features **overly dramatic titles** like “Professional Time Waster” or “Certified Overthinker.”
* Can be proudly printed, framed, and shown to your future employer (if you’re not interested in getting hired).

### 2️⃣ **വീണപൂവ് – The Worst AI Lawyer**

> An AI lawyer who **always loses your case** — and looks fabulous doing it.

**What it does**

* Uses GPT (or silly local data if you’re broke) to craft *absurd legal arguments*.
* Generates fake “Exhibits” like **Cheetos dust evidence** or **suspicious cat behavior diagrams**.
* Delivers a **final verdict** that dooms you in style.
* Comes with courtroom drama, sarcasm, and **zero legal usefulness**.

## **⚡ Why These Projects Exist**

Because:

1. We didn’t want to be like everyone else.
2. We believe in the **art of wasting time** — but in a *productive-looking* way.
3. Two useless projects > One useless project.

## **🚀 How to Use**

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open each project folder.
3. Run the magic (and then question your life choices).

## **📌 Disclaimer**

* These projects are for **fun and chaos only**.
* Do not submit these to a real court of law (or maybe do, if you like jail).
* KTU students — use the certificate generator responsibly… or irresponsibly.
