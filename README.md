🎭 Team NAME RADO – The Art of Doing Absolutely Nothing Useful
Because the world has enough productivity. We’re here for the nonsense.

1️⃣ ScrollPoints – Certificate for Reel Scrolling
Turning your endless scrolling habit into an academic achievement.

What it does

Tracks how long you waste scrolling Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and other dopamine traps.

At the end of your “session” (aka life slipping away), it generates a prestigious certificate congratulating you on your world-class procrastination.

Can even auto-print your name with fonts that scream “proud but ashamed.”

Features

Real-time scroll timer ⏳

Official-looking PDF certificate 🏆

Completely useless for jobs, but perfect for shaming your friends

2️⃣ വീണപൂവ് – The Worst AI Lawyer
An AI lawyer who always loses your case — but at least makes you laugh before you go to jail.

What it does

Harnesses the power of GPT (or a dodgy free API key) to create spectacularly bad legal arguments.

Generates fake “Exhibits” such as:

Cheetos dust forensic evidence

Suspicious cat behavior diagrams

Excel sheets proving nothing

Delivers a final verdict that’s 100% against you, no matter the evidence.

Comes with over-the-top courtroom drama, sarcasm, and absolutely zero legal usefulness.

Why it exists
Because life is short, justice is overrated, and sometimes you just need an AI that can fail spectacularly — but make it entertaining.

🏆 Why these projects are masterpieces
They solve problems nobody had.

They produce results nobody asked for.

They showcase technology used in the most unserious way possible.

💡 Built With
Python – because why not

Streamlit – to make it look like a real app

OpenAI API – when we wanted to feel fancy

Our collective lack of shame – the true framework behind it all

🚫 Disclaimer
These projects are NOT meant for real-life legal help, productivity tracking, or any other serious use.
We are not responsible if:

You take വീണപൂവ്’s legal advice seriously.

You put “Certificate in Scrolling” on your resume.

Your friends start avoiding you because you built these.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
